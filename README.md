# Weather-Master

I use https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall for getting data.

This API gives only 7 days of data. 
So I use Static data to show future forecast.

You can find static data in com.weather.master.ui.activity.main.FutureForecast file.
I use model for static data so we can easily replace with original API response.

you can find Base Url in build.gradle file.

If Application don't find location then it will show only three city data.

It shows different background according to weather.

If you need any other info please contact me.


Thank you
Ankit
