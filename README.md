# Weather-Master

I use https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall for getting data.

This API gives only 7 days of data. 
So I use Static data to show Future Forecast.

You can find static data in com.weather.master.ui.activity.main.FutureForecast file.
I use model for static data so we can easly replace with original API response.

you can find Base Url in buil.gradle file.

If you need any other info please contact me.


Thank you
Ankit
